-- Really lost on the atom feed stuff for Task G2. Should make another run through it


TIPS & GOTCHAS:
-- Apparently the rails server will try to automatically detect the database adapter
   based on environment variables. this is done quietly and without notice...which is
   really awesomely confusing. While the environment variable DATABASE_URL is set,
   rails assumes that you are using postgresql. Maybe there is a hiarchy for
   determining the database type (e.g. config file > environment variables), but
   that wasn't clear at all.
